imgurgo
=======

This is my way of getting some experience in writing Go code, while also trying to create a user friendly API.
I'm trying to keep `master` compilable and working, but I don't promise anything.

Currently, my wrapper only wraps imgur's image endpoint. I hope to have time to expand the wrapper beyond images, i.e. also including albums, comments and all other endpoints of imgur's API.
